# _Riddles of the Tolkien Sphinx_

_19 September_

#### _A simple riddle game_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

_This is a project for Epicodus to practice setting up a C3 project and using C# syntax. The original directions for the project include:_

Create a console application where the Sphinx asks a riddle and the user must answer the riddle correctly. If the riddle is answered correctly, the Sphinx asks a second riddle and so on.

Start with one riddle. If the user answers correctly, the Sphinx is defeated. If the user is incorrect, the Sphinx eats the user.
Once the application is working with a single riddle, add a few more.
Try writing a method to randomize which riddle the Sphinx asks.
_I decided to use riddles from J.R.R. Tolkien's **The Hobbit.**_

## Specifications
| Spec     | Behavior | Input    | Output   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | The program provides a riddle: "What has roots as nobody sees, Is taller than trees, Up, up it goes, And yet never grows?" If the user answers incorrectly, the Sphinx eats the user. | I dunno | Oh no! You've asnwered incorrectly. The Sphinx has eaten you! |
| 2 | The program provides a riddle. If the user answers correctly, the Sphinx is defeated.  | a mountain | You are wise indeed! You have defeated the Sphinx |
| 3 | When the user answers correctly, the Sphinx provides a new riddle. | mountain | Correct! Now riddle me this: Thirty white horses on a red hill, First they champ, Then they stamp, Then they stand still. |
| 4 | The program randomizes the riddle asked for each question. | Question 1 | Voiceless it cries, Wingless flutters, Toothless bites, Mouthless mutters. |
